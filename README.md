## Soft Skills

#### Ability to learn

- Strong commitment to continuous learning, evident in my recent completion of an intensive Makers' Coding Bootcamp where I efficiently learned new skills and methodologies. Such as, I engaged in project-based learning that allowed me to acquire proficiency in database management, particularly with PostgreSQL and MongoDB technologies. By actively working on projects and applying database query languages, I gained a deep understanding of their practical applications in data-driven applications. This hands-on experience not only enhanced my ability to handle complex data structures but also solidified my knowledge of database management.
- Demonstrated adaptability during my tenure at Boots by quickly adapting to the implementation of self-checkout tills during the busiest period of the year. Learned how to effectively manage the new tills, ensuring optimal customer service and supporting fellow staff members.
- Actively seek out opportunities to apply and test my expanding knowledge base. As a Student Ambassador, I leveraged my postgraduate course learnings to support and educate secondary students whilst honing my ability to communicate complex ideas to diverse audiences effectively. 

#### Team Player

- Demonstrated strong team player skills by effectively collaborating as a valuable member of Agile teams during the coding bootcamp. Showcased effective communication and a commitment to project success by utilising agile best practices including daily stand-ups, retrospectives, and short delivery cycles to foster good communication and ensure efficient teamwork. Additionally, I used digital tools like Miro and Excalidraw to diagram and visually communicate ideas to improve clarity and understanding among team members.
- Thrived in diverse environments during studies and a year-long exchange program, showcasing my ability to work effectively with individuals from different backgrounds and disciplines. I applied this experience to collaborate effectively with diverse engineering teams during the coding bootcamp.
- Co-founded and managed a Society during my undergraduate studies: Executed nine main events with more than 50 attendees on the opening event and facilitated collaboration with another society, organizing a friendly sports competition to foster community engagement and inter-society relationships.

#### Adaptability

- Completed a transformative one-year exchange program in Japan where I adapted to a new culture and language, which is similar to the process of acquiring technical skills in software development.
- Transitioned from a design-focused background to a more technical course in Industrial Digitalisation and the intensive Makers' coding bootcamp.
- Caregiving during Covid times, pivoted and took on the responsibility of caring for my medically ill grandmother full time, which required me to handle stressful situations and find creative solutions to unexpected challenges.

#### User-focused approach

- Leveraged my design background to prioritise user needs and specifications when solving problems, applying the principles of human-centred design. I understand that the user is at the centre of every product, and my approach to problem-solving reflects this mindset.
- Demonstrated a strong commitment to customer satisfaction through over 4 years of experience providing exceptional and consistent customer service within the retail industry. Consistently met and exceeded customer expectations.
